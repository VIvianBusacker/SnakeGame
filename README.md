<p1>Welcome to my JavaScript-based Snake Game! This project was created as part of my efforts to enhance my skills in front-end development and game design using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game is simple, yet demonstrates core programming concepts like event handling, DOM manipulation, and game loop mechanics.</p1>

<h2>üéÆ Gameplay</h2>
<p2>The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it consumes food. The goal is to survive as long as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.</p2>

<h3> Controls: </h3>
<li>Arrow keys to change the snake's direction.</li>
<li>Up Arrow: Move up.</li>
<li>Down Arrow: Move down.</li>
<li>Left Arrow: Move left.</li>
<li>Right Arrow: Move right.</li>
<li>The game increases in difficulty as the snake grows longer and moves faster. Test your reflexes and set a new high score!</li>

<h4>üíª Technologies Used </h4>
<p3>HTML5 for structuring the game interface.
CSS3 for styling the game canvas and elements.
JavaScript for game logic, including the snake's movement, collision detection, and score tracking.
Canvas API for rendering the snake and game board. </p3>

<h5> üöÄ Features </h5>
<p4>Responsive game board: Adapts to different screen sizes.
Dynamic gameplay: The snake grows longer with each food consumed.
Score tracking: Keeps track of the player's score and displays it in real-time.
Game over detection: The game ends when the snake hits the walls or itself.</p4>
