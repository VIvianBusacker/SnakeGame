<h1>#Snake Game 🐍</h1>

<p1>Welcome to my JavaScript-based Snake Game! This project was created as part of my efforts to enhance my skills in front-end development and game design using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game is simple, yet demonstrates core programming concepts like event handling, DOM manipulation, and game loop mechanics.</p1>

<h2>🎮 Gameplay</h2>
<p2>The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it consumes food. The goal is to survive as long as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.</p2>
